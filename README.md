# CSS Triggers (2024 Remake)

This is a remake of the original [CSS Triggers](https://csstriggers.com/) website, which was created by [Paul Lewis](https://twitter.com/aerotwist) and [Surma](https://twitter.com/dassurma). The original website looks like it's been replaced with a marketing site. This remake is based on the original website, but with a new design.

If you have any data for missing CSS properties, or up to date info for some of the existing properties, then please open an issue.
